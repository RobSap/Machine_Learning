This file covers the concepts of Unigrams and Naive bayesian networks


This program uses the concept of Unigram to count works in spam and ham emails. 
Then it uses a Naive baysian network to determinte probabilty of given a word, if its ham
or spam. 
After a Unigram is done using both ham and spam, it then uses the probabily to calculate,
the probabily of each email in a test set is Ham or Spam.

For School

This exercise concerns the classification of spam email. Create a corpus of spam email and one of non-spam mail. Examine each corpus and decide what features appear to be useful for classification: unigram words? bigrams? trigram message length, sender, time of arrival? Then train classification algorithm on a training set and report its accuracy on a test set.

I am using a unigram. 

I send the unigram for ham into a hashmap.
I send the unigram for spam into a hashmap2.
I send both of them with the calcuation with probability of it being a spam.

Then I send the test data in a unigram and compare it against he porbability the word is a spam word.
Then calculate the % chance the email is a spam.

At the end I report the amount of spam and the amount of ham.

Then report the % actuaraccy.
